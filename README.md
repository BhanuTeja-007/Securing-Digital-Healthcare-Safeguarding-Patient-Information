# üõ°Ô∏è Securing Digital Healthcare: Safeguarding Patient Information

This repository contains the final project report, supporting documentation, and implementation recommendations for **Securing Digital Healthcare**, a cybersecurity strategy focused on protecting electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) in modern healthcare systems.

Developed as part of an academic project, the solution proposes a layered cybersecurity architecture designed to achieve compliance with HIPAA and PCI DSS regulations, mitigate modern cyber threats, and enhance operational resilience.

## üìñ Overview

The healthcare industry faces increasing cyberattack risks due to outdated systems, unsegmented networks, and low security awareness. This project provides a comprehensive assessment of a vulnerable healthcare infrastructure and proposes a defense-in-depth solution to protect patient information while meeting regulatory requirements.

---

## üéØ Objectives

1. Achieve full compliance with **HIPAA** and **PCI DSS**.
2. Protect patient data from breaches, ransomware, and unauthorized access.
3. Enhance security posture using a **multi-layered defense model**.
4. Implement technical and organizational safeguards to ensure long-term cybersecurity maturity.

## üè• Current Challenges Identified

- Flat network architecture without segmentation
- Outdated Windows 7 systems with no patch management
- Unencrypted patient data in transit and at rest
- No SIEM, IDS/IPS, or endpoint protection
- Use of unsecured email for PHI transmission
- Absence of MFA, ACLs, and secure IAM practices
- No employee cybersecurity training programs

## ‚úÖ Proposed Security Enhancements

| Control Area                  | Proposed Solution                                               |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Network Segmentation**     | Isolate critical systems to limit lateral movement              |
| **EDR + Patch Management**   | Real-time endpoint protection and vulnerability remediation     |
| **Next-Gen Firewalls (NGFW)**| DPI, application filtering, threat intelligence integration      |
| **SIEM + IDS/IPS**           | Centralized threat monitoring and prevention                    |
| **Data Encryption**          | Encrypt PHI both at rest and in transit                         |
| **IAM + MFA**                | Role-based access control with multi-factor authentication      |
| **Secure Communications**    | TLS-based secure email and collaboration tools                  |
| **WAF**                      | Protection from web-based attacks (SQLi, XSS, etc.)              |
| **HIPAA Compliance Mapping** | Full alignment with privacy, security, and breach rules         |

## üîê Compliance Alignment: HIPAA Safeguards

- **Administrative**: Risk assessments, workforce training, breach notifications  
- **Technical**: Access control, encryption, audit logs, transmission security  
- **Physical**: Workstation security, facility access control, device/media protection

## üí∏ Estimated Budget for Implementation

| Component                         | Estimated Cost |
|----------------------------------|----------------|
| Endpoint Detection & Response    | $50,000        |
| SIEM (e.g., Splunk, QRadar)      | $80,000        |
| IDS/IPS                          | $60,000        |
| Identity Management (IAM)        | $40,000        |
| Data Encryption                  | $30,000        |
| Patch Management Tools           | $30,000        |
| Secure Collaboration Tools       | $20,000        |
| Remote Monitoring & Management   | $50,000        |
| **Total**                        | ~$360,000      |

## üß≠ Future Recommendations

- Establish an internal or hybrid **Security Operations Center (SOC)**
- Integrate **AI/ML** for behavior-based threat detection
- Invest in **digital forensics** tools and incident response simulations
- Expand **employee security awareness training** (gamified, scenario-based)
- Transition to **cloud-native security platforms** for scalability and resilience

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud-Based Alternative

The report also evaluates a **cloud-native approach** featuring:
- CrowdStrike for endpoint security
- Azure AD/Okta for IAM
- Sumo Logic for SIEM
- Microsoft Defender CASB
- TLS-enforced encrypted communications
- PCI DSS-compliant payment processing
